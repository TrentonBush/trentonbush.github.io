I'm a data scientist with a background in IoT and renewable energy. For the past three years, I have worked with industrial IoT data from the wind turbine industry, predicting future power generation and monitoring critical sensor networks. Most recently, I built automated sensor monitoring and predictive maintenance capabilities at a digital product startup. I believe my product focus, combined statistics and engineering knowledge, and industrial IoT experience make me a compelling candidate for work in the IoT space and beyond.
